now king david was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. eos wherefore his servants said unto him, let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. eos so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of israel, and found abishag a shunammite, and brought her to the king. eos and the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not. eos then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself, saying, i will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. eos and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after absalom. eos and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah, and with abiathar the priest: and they following adonijah helped him. eos but zadok the priest, and benaiah the son of jehoiada, and nathan the prophet, and shimei, and rei, and the mighty men which belonged to david, were not with adonijah. eos and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth, which is by enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of judah the king's servants: eos but nathan the prophet, and benaiah, and the mighty men, and solomon his brother, he called not. eos wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon, saying, hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign, and david our lord knoweth it not? eos now therefore come, let me, i pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son solomon. eos go and get thee in unto king david, and say unto him, didst not thou, my lord, o king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth adonijah reign? eos behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, i also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words. eos and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the king. eos and bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. and the king said, what wouldest thou? eos and she said unto him, my lord, thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid, saying, assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. eos and now, behold, adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not: eos and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and abiathar the priest, and joab the captain of the host: but solomon thy servant hath he not called. eos and thou, my lord, o king, the eyes of all israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. eos otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders. eos and, lo, while she yet talked with the king, nathan the prophet also came in. eos and they told the king, saying, behold nathan the prophet. and when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. eos and nathan said, my lord, o king, hast thou said, adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? eos for he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, god save king adonijah. eos but me, even me thy servant, and zadok the priest, and benaiah the son of jehoiada, and thy servant solomon, hath he not called. eos is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him? eos then king david answered and said, call me bathsheba. and she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. eos and the king sware, and said, as the lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, eos even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel, saying, assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will i certainly do this day. eos then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, let my lord king david live for ever. eos and king david said, call me zadok the priest, and nathan the prophet, and benaiah the son of jehoiada. and they came before the king. eos the king also said unto them, take with you the servants of your lord, and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to gihon: eos and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, god save king solomon. eos then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah. eos and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king, and said, amen: the lord god of my lord the king say so too. eos as the lord hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david. eos so zadok the priest, and nathan the prophet, and benaiah the son of jehoiada, and the cherethites, and the pelethites, went down, and caused solomon to ride upon king david's mule, and brought him to gihon. eos and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed solomon. and they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, god save king solomon. eos and all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them. eos and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar? eos and while he yet spake, behold, jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came; and adonijah said unto him, come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. eos and jonathan answered and said to adonijah, verily our lord king david hath made solomon king. eos and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest, and nathan the prophet, and benaiah the son of jehoiada, and the cherethites, and the pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule: eos and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. this is the noise that ye have heard. eos and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. eos and moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king david, saying, god make the name of solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. and the king bowed himself upon the bed. eos and also thus said the king, blessed be the lord god of israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it. eos and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. eos and adonijah feared because of solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. eos and it was told solomon, saying, behold, adonijah feareth king solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword. eos and solomon said, if he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die. eos so king solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. and he came and bowed himself to king solomon: and solomon said unto him, go to thine house. eos now the days of david drew nigh that he should die; and he charged solomon his son, saying, eos i go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; eos and keep the charge of the lord thy god, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: eos that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, if thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of israel. eos moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel, unto abner the son of ner, and unto amasa the son of jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet. eos do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. eos but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother. eos and, behold, thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera, a benjamite of bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at jordan, and i sware to him by the lord, saying, i will not put thee to death with the sword. eos now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood. eos so david slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of david. eos and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem. eos then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father; and his kingdom was established greatly. eos and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon. and she said, comest thou peaceably? and he said, peaceably. eos he said moreover, i have somewhat to say unto thee. and she said, say on. eos and he said, thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all israel set their faces on me, that i should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the lord. eos and now i ask one petition of thee, deny me not. and she said unto him, say on. eos and he said, speak, i pray thee, unto solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife. eos and bathsheba said, well; i will speak for thee unto the king. eos bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon, to speak unto him for adonijah. and the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. eos then she said, i desire one small petition of thee; i pray thee, say me not nay. and the king said unto her, ask on, my mother: for i will not say thee nay. eos and she said, let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife. eos and king solomon answered and said unto his mother, and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for abiathar the priest, and for joab the son of zeruiah. eos then king solomon sware by the lord, saying, god do so to me, and more also, if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. eos now therefore, as the lord liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of david my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, adonijah shall be put to death this day. eos and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died. eos and unto abiathar the priest said the king, get thee to anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but i will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. eos so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord; that he might fulfil the word of the lord, which he spake concerning the house of eli in shiloh. eos then tidings came to joab: for joab had turned after adonijah, though he turned not after absalom. and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. eos and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord; and, behold, he is by the altar. then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada, saying, go, fall upon him. eos and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord, and said unto him, thus saith the king, come forth. and he said, nay; but i will die here. and benaiah brought the king word again, saying, thus said joab, and thus he answered me. eos and the king said unto him, do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. eos and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father david not knowing thereof, to wit, abner the son of ner, captain of the host of israel, and amasa the son of jether, captain of the host of judah. eos their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon david, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the lord. eos so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. eos and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host: and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar. eos and the king sent and called for shimei, and said unto him, build thee an house in jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. eos for it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. eos and shimei said unto the king, the saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days. eos and it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath. and they told shimei, saying, behold, thy servants be in gath. eos and shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to gath to achish to seek his servants: and shimei went, and brought his servants from gath. eos and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath, and was come again. eos and the king sent and called for shimei, and said unto him, did i not make thee to swear by the lord, and protested unto thee, saying, know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, the word that i have heard is good. eos why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord, and the commandment that i have charged thee with? eos the king said moreover to shimei, thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to david my father: therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; eos and king solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever. eos so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon. eos and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt, and took pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of david, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the lord, and the wall of jerusalem round about. eos only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the lord, until those days. eos and solomon loved the lord, walking in the statutes of david his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. eos and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar. eos in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night: and god said, ask what i shall give thee. eos and solomon said, thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. eos and now, o lord my god, thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father: and i am but a little child: i know not how to go out or come in. eos and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. eos give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that i may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people? eos and the speech pleased the lord, that solomon had asked this thing. eos and god said unto him, because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment; eos behold, i have done according to thy words: lo, i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. eos and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. eos and if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father david did walk, then i will lengthen thy days. eos and solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. and he came to jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. eos then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. eos and the one woman said, o my lord, i and this woman dwell in one house; and i was delivered of a child with her in the house. eos and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. eos and this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it. eos and she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. eos and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when i had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which i did bear. eos and the other woman said, nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. and this said, no; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. thus they spake before the king. eos then said the king, the one saith, this is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. eos and the king said, bring me a sword. and they brought a sword before the king. eos and the king said, divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. eos then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, o my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. but the other said, let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. eos then the king answered and said, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. eos and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him, to do judgment. eos so king solomon was king over all israel. eos and these were the princes which he had; azariah the son of zadok the priest, eos elihoreph and ahiah, the sons of shisha, scribes; jehoshaphat the son of ahilud, the recorder. eos and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host: and zadok and abiathar were the priests: eos and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers: and zabud the son of nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend: eos and ahishar was over the household: and adoniram the son of abda was over the tribute. eos and solomon had twelve officers over all israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. eos and these are their names: the son of hur, in mount ephraim: eos the son of dekar, in makaz, and in shaalbim, and bethshemesh, and elonbethhanan: eos the son of hesed, in aruboth; to him pertained sochoh, and all the land of hepher: eos the son of abinadab, in all the region of dor; which had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife: eos baana the son of ahilud; to him pertained taanach and megiddo, and all bethshean, which is by zartanah beneath jezreel, from bethshean to abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond jokneam: eos the son of geber, in ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of jair the son of manasseh, which are in gilead; to him also pertained the region of argob, which is in bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: eos ahinadab the son of iddo had mahanaim: eos ahimaaz was in naphtali; he also took basmath the daughter of solomon to wife: eos baanah the son of hushai was in asher and in aloth: eos jehoshaphat the son of paruah, in issachar: eos shimei the son of elah, in benjamin: eos geber the son of uri was in the country of gilead, in the country of sihon king of the amorites, and of og king of bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land. eos judah and israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. eos and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the philistines, and unto the border of egypt: they brought presents, and served solomon all the days of his life. eos and solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, eos ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. eos for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from tiphsah even to azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. eos and judah and israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from dan even to beersheba, all the days of solomon. eos and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. eos and those officers provided victual for king solomon, and for all that came unto king solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. eos barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge. eos and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. eos and solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of egypt. eos for he was wiser than all men; than ethan the ezrahite, and heman, and chalcol, and darda, the sons of mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. eos and he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. eos and he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. eos and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom. eos and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for hiram was ever a lover of david. eos and solomon sent to hiram, saying, eos thou knowest how that david my father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his god for the wars which were about him on every side, until the lord put them under the soles of his feet. eos but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent. eos and, behold, i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord my god, as the lord spake unto david my father, saying, thy son, whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name. eos now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians. eos and it came to pass, when hiram heard the words of solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, blessed be the lord this day, which hath given unto david a wise son over this great people. eos and hiram sent to solomon, saying, i have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. eos my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea: and i will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household. eos so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire. eos and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave solomon to hiram year by year. eos and the lord gave solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between hiram and solomon; and they two made a league together. eos and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. eos and he sent them to lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in lebanon, and two months at home: and adoniram was over the levy. eos and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; eos beside the chief of solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. eos and the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. eos and solomon's builders and hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house. eos and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt, in the fourth year of solomon's reign over israel, in the month zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the lord. eos and the house which king solomon built for the lord, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. eos and the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house. eos and for the house he made windows of narrow lights. eos and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about: eos the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house. eos and the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. eos the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third. eos so he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. eos and then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. eos and the word of the lord came to solomon, saying, eos concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will i perform my word with thee, which i spake unto david thy father: eos and i will dwell among the children of israel, and will not forsake my people israel. eos so solomon built the house, and finished it. eos and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. eos and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place. eos and the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long. eos and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen. eos and the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the lord. eos and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar. eos so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. eos and the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold. eos and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high. eos and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. eos and the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size. eos the height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. eos and he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. eos and he overlaid the cherubims with gold. eos and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without. eos and the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. eos and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall. eos the two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees. eos so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall. eos and the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. eos and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work. eos and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams. eos in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid, in the month zif: eos and in the eleventh year, in the month bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. so was he seven years in building it. eos but solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. eos he built also the house of the forest of lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. eos and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row. eos and there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks. eos and all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks. eos and he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them. eos then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other. eos and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. solomon made also an house for pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch. eos all these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court. eos and the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. eos and above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars. eos and the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the lord, and for the porch of the house. eos and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre. eos he was a widow's son of the tribe of naphtali, and his father was a man of tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. and he came to king solomon, and wrought all his work. eos for he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. eos and he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits: eos and nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. eos and he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter. eos and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits. eos and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter. eos and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof boaz. eos and upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished. eos and he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. eos and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast. eos it stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. eos and it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. eos and he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. eos and the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges: eos and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work. eos and every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition. eos and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round. eos and under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. eos and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten. eos and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself. eos and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same. eos for on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about. eos after this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size. eos then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. eos and he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. eos and hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. so hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon for the house of the lord: eos the two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; eos and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; eos and the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; eos and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; eos and the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which hiram made to king solomon for the house of the lord, were of bright brass. eos in the plain of jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan. eos and solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out. eos and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was, eos and the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, eos and the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple. eos so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of the lord. and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the lord. eos then solomon assembled the elders of israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of israel, unto king solomon in jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david, which is zion. eos and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim, which is the seventh month. eos and all the elders of israel came, and the priests took up the ark. eos and they brought up the ark of the lord, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the levites bring up. eos and king solomon, and all the congregation of israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. eos and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims. eos for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. eos and they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day. eos there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which moses put there at horeb, when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel, when they came out of the land of egypt. eos and it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the lord, eos so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord. eos then spake solomon, the lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. eos i have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever. eos and the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of israel: (and all the congregation of israel stood;) eos and he said, blessed be the lord god of israel, which spake with his mouth unto david my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying, eos since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt, i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but i chose david to be over my people israel. eos and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel. eos and the lord said unto david my father, whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart. eos nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name. eos and the lord hath performed his word that he spake, and i am risen up in the room of david my father, and sit on the throne of israel, as the lord promised, and have built an house for the name of the lord god of israel. eos and i have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the lord, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of egypt. eos and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven: eos and he said, lord god of israel, there is no god like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart: eos who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day. eos therefore now, lord god of israel, keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him, saying, there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me. eos and now, o god of israel, let thy word, i pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father. eos but will god indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that i have builded? eos yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, o lord my god, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day: eos that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, my name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place. eos and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive. eos if any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house: eos then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. eos when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: eos then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. eos when heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: eos then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. eos if there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; eos what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: eos then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) eos that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. eos moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake; eos (for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house; eos hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people israel; and that they may know that this house, which i have builded, is called by thy name. eos if thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that i have built for thy name: eos then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. eos if they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near; eos yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, we have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; eos and so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which i have built for thy name: eos then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause, eos and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them: eos for they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: eos that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee. eos for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt, o lord god. eos and it was so, that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord, he arose from before the altar of the lord, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. eos and he stood, and blessed all the congregation of israel with a loud voice, saying, eos blessed be the lord, that hath given rest unto his people israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of moses his servant. eos the lord our god be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: eos that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. eos and let these my words, wherewith i have made supplication before the lord, be nigh unto the lord our god day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people israel at all times, as the matter shall require: eos that all the people of the earth may know that the lord is god, and that there is none else. eos let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day. eos and the king, and all israel with him, offered sacrifice before the lord. eos and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of the lord. eos the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. eos and at that time solomon held a feast, and all israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt, before the lord our god, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days. eos on the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord had done for david his servant, and for israel his people. eos and it came to pass, when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord, and the king's house, and all solomon's desire which he was pleased to do, eos that the lord appeared to solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at gibeon. eos and the lord said unto him, i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: i have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. eos and if thou wilt walk before me, as david thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that i have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: eos then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever, as i promised to david thy father, saying, there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel. eos but if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them: eos then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them; and this house, which i have hallowed for my name, will i cast out of my sight; and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people: eos and at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, why hath the lord done thus unto this land, and to this house? eos and they shall answer, because they forsook the lord their god, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil. eos and it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when solomon had built the two houses, the house of the lord, and the king's house, eos (now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee. eos and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. eos and he said, what cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? and he called them the land of cabul unto this day. eos and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. eos and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised; for to build the house of the lord, and his own house, and millo, and the wall of jerusalem, and hazor, and megiddo, and gezer. eos for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up, and taken gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, solomon's wife. eos and solomon built gezer, and bethhoron the nether, eos and baalath, and tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, eos and all the cities of store that solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which solomon desired to build in jerusalem, and in lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. eos and all the people that were left of the amorites, hittites, perizzites, hivites, and jebusites, which were not of the children of israel, eos their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day. eos but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. eos these were the chief of the officers that were over solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work. eos but pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which solomon had built for her: then did he build millo. eos and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord. so he finished the house. eos and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber, which is beside eloth, on the shore of the red sea, in the land of edom. eos and hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of solomon. eos and they came to ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king solomon. eos and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord, she came to prove him with hard questions. eos and she came to jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. eos and solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not. eos and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, eos and the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord; there was no more spirit in her. eos and she said to the king, it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. eos howbeit i believed not the words, until i came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard. eos happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. eos blessed be the lord thy god, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of israel: because the lord loved israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice. eos and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon. eos and the navy also of hiram, that brought gold from ophir, brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. eos and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the lord, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day. eos and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty. so she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. eos now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, eos beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of arabia, and of the governors of the country. eos and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. eos and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon. eos moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. eos the throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. eos and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. eos and all king solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon. eos for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram: once in three years came the navy of tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. eos so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. eos and all the earth sought to solomon, to hear his wisdom, which god had put in his heart. eos and they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. eos and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at jerusalem. eos and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance. eos and solomon had horses brought out of egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. eos and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the hittites, and for the kings of syria, did they bring them out by their means. eos but king solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of pharaoh, women of the moabites, ammonites, edomites, zidonians, and hittites: eos of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel, ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: solomon clave unto these in love. eos and he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. eos for it came to pass, when solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god, as was the heart of david his father. eos for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians, and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites. eos and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord, and went not fully after the lord, as did david his father. eos then did solomon build an high place for chemosh, the abomination of moab, in the hill that is before jerusalem, and for molech, the abomination of the children of ammon. eos and likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods. eos and the lord was angry with solomon, because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel, which had appeared unto him twice, eos and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the lord commanded. eos wherefore the lord said unto solomon, forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which i have commanded thee, i will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. eos notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy father's sake: but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son. eos howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servant's sake, and for jerusalem's sake which i have chosen. eos and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon, hadad the edomite: he was of the king's seed in edom. eos for it came to pass, when david was in edom, and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in edom; eos (for six months did joab remain there with all israel, until he had cut off every male in edom:) eos that hadad fled, he and certain edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into egypt; hadad being yet a little child. eos and they arose out of midian, and came to paran: and they took men with them out of paran, and they came to egypt, unto pharaoh king of egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. eos and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of tahpenes the queen. eos and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son, whom tahpenes weaned in pharaoh's house: and genubath was in pharaoh's household among the sons of pharaoh. eos and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers, and that joab the captain of the host was dead, hadad said to pharaoh, let me depart, that i may go to mine own country. eos then pharaoh said unto him, but what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? and he answered, nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise. eos and god stirred him up another adversary, rezon the son of eliadah, which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah: eos and he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when david slew them of zobah: and they went to damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in damascus. eos and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon, beside the mischief that hadad did: and he abhorred israel, and reigned over syria. eos and jeroboam the son of nebat, an ephrathite of zereda, solomon's servant, whose mother's name was zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king. eos and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: solomon built millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of david his father. eos and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph. eos and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem, that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field: eos and ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces: eos and he said to jeroboam, take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the lord, the god of israel, behold, i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee: eos (but he shall have one tribe for my servant david's sake, and for jerusalem's sake, the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel:) eos because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians, chemosh the god of the moabites, and milcom the god of the children of ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did david his father. eos howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servant's sake, whom i chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: eos but i will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes. eos and unto his son will i give one tribe, that david my servant may have a light alway before me in jerusalem, the city which i have chosen me to put my name there. eos and i will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over israel. eos and it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as david my servant did; that i will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as i built for david, and will give israel unto thee. eos and i will for this afflict the seed of david, but not for ever. eos solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam. and jeroboam arose, and fled into egypt, unto shishak king of egypt, and was in egypt until the death of solomon. eos and the rest of the acts of solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon? eos and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years. eos and solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of david his father: and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. eos and rehoboam went to shechem: for all israel were come to shechem to make him king. eos and it came to pass, when jeroboam the son of nebat, who was yet in egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king solomon, and jeroboam dwelt in egypt;) eos that they sent and called him. and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came, and spake unto rehoboam, saying, eos thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. eos and he said unto them, depart yet for three days, then come again to me. and the people departed. eos and king rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, how do ye advise that i may answer this people? eos and they spake unto him, saying, if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. eos but he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him: eos and he said unto them, what counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? eos and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, my little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins. eos and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, i will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but i will chastise you with scorpions. eos so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, come to me again the third day. eos and the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him; eos and spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, my father made your yoke heavy, and i will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but i will chastise you with scorpions. eos wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the lord, that he might perform his saying, which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat. eos so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, what portion have we in david? neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse: to your tents, o israel: now see to thine own house, david. so israel departed unto their tents. eos but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the cities of judah, rehoboam reigned over them. eos then king rehoboam sent adoram, who was over the tribute; and all israel stoned him with stones, that he died. therefore king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to jerusalem. eos so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day. eos and it came to pass, when all israel heard that jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all israel: there was none that followed the house of david, but the tribe of judah only. eos and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem, he assembled all the house of judah, with the tribe of benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of israel, to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon. eos but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god, saying, eos speak unto rehoboam, the son of solomon, king of judah, and unto all the house of judah and benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, eos thus saith the lord, ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. they hearkened therefore to the word of the lord, and returned to depart, according to the word of the lord. eos then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built penuel. eos and jeroboam said in his heart, now shall the kingdom return to the house of david: eos if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto rehoboam king of judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to rehoboam king of judah. eos whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem: behold thy gods, o israel, which brought thee up out of the land of egypt. eos and he set the one in bethel, and the other put he in dan. eos and this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto dan. eos and he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of levi. eos and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in judah, and he offered upon the altar. so did he in bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. eos so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense. eos and, behold, there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel: and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. eos and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord, and said, o altar, altar, thus saith the lord; behold, a child shall be born unto the house of david, josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee. eos and he gave a sign the same day, saying, this is the sign which the lord hath spoken; behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out. eos and it came to pass, when king jeroboam heard the saying of the man of god, which had cried against the altar in bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, lay hold on him. and his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. eos the altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord. eos and the king answered and said unto the man of god, intreat now the face of the lord thy god, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. and the man of god besought the lord, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before. eos and the king said unto the man of god, come home with me, and refresh thyself, and i will give thee a reward. eos and the man of god said unto the king, if thou wilt give me half thine house, i will not go in with thee, neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place: eos for so was it charged me by the word of the lord, saying, eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest. eos so he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to bethel. eos now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father. eos and their father said unto them, what way went he? for his sons had seen what way the man of god went, which came from judah. eos and he said unto his sons, saddle me the ass. so they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon, eos and went after the man of god, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, art thou the man of god that camest from judah? and he said, i am. eos then he said unto him, come home with me, and eat bread. eos and he said, i may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: eos for it was said to me by the word of the lord, thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. eos he said unto him, i am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord, saying, bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. but he lied unto him. eos so he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. eos and it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back: eos and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah, saying, thus saith the lord, forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee, eos but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the lord did say to thee, eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers. eos and it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back. eos and when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase. eos and, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. eos and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, it is the man of god, who was disobedient unto the word of the lord: therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the lord, which he spake unto him. eos and he spake to his sons, saying, saddle me the ass. and they saddled him. eos and he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass. eos and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him. eos and he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, alas, my brother! eos and it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, when i am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried; lay my bones beside his bones: eos for the saying which he cried by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria, shall surely come to pass. eos after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places. eos and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth. eos at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick. eos and jeroboam said to his wife, arise, i pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam; and get thee to shiloh: behold, there is ahijah the prophet, which told me that i should be king over this people. eos and take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child. eos and jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to shiloh, and came to the house of ahijah. but ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. eos and the lord said unto ahijah, behold, the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman. eos and it was so, when ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, come in, thou wife of jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for i am sent to thee with heavy tidings. eos go, tell jeroboam, thus saith the lord god of israel, forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people israel, eos and rent the kingdom away from the house of david, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant david, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes; eos but hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: eos therefore, behold, i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam, and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone. eos him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the lord hath spoken it. eos arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. eos and all israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam. eos moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel, who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day: but what? even now. eos for the lord shall smite israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the lord to anger. eos and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam, who did sin, and who made israel to sin. eos and jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; eos and they buried him; and all israel mourned for him, according to the word of the lord, which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet. eos and the rest of the acts of jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel. eos and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and nadab his son reigned in his stead. eos and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah. rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem, the city which the lord did choose out of all the tribes of israel, to put his name there. and his mother's name was naamah an ammonitess. eos and judah did evil in the sight of the lord, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done. eos for they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree. eos and there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord cast out before the children of israel. eos and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam, that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem: eos and he took away the treasures of the house of the lord, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made. eos and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house. eos and it was so, when the king went into the house of the lord, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber. eos now the rest of the acts of rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah? eos and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days. eos and rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of david. and his mother's name was naamah an ammonitess. and abijam his son reigned in his stead. eos now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reigned abijam over judah. eos three years reigned he in jerusalem. and his mother's name was maachah, the daughter of abishalom. eos and he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god, as the heart of david his father. eos nevertheless for david's sake did the lord his god give him a lamp in jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish jerusalem: eos because david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of uriah the hittite. eos and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life. eos now the rest of the acts of abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah? and there was war between abijam and jeroboam. eos and abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of david: and asa his son reigned in his stead. eos and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa over judah. eos and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem. and his mother's name was maachah, the daughter of abishalom. eos and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord, as did david his father. eos and he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. eos and also maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook kidron. eos but the high places were not removed: nevertheless asa's heart was perfect with the lord all his days. eos and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the lord, silver, and gold, and vessels. eos and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days. eos and baasha king of israel went up against judah, and built ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah. eos then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king asa sent them to benhadad, the son of tabrimon, the son of hezion, king of syria, that dwelt at damascus, saying, eos there is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with baasha king of israel, that he may depart from me. eos so benhadad hearkened unto king asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of israel, and smote ijon, and dan, and abelbethmaachah, and all cinneroth, with all the land of naphtali. eos and it came to pass, when baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of ramah, and dwelt in tirzah. eos then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith baasha had builded; and king asa built with them geba of benjamin, and mizpah. eos the rest of all the acts of asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah? nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. eos and asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father: and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. eos and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah, and reigned over israel two years. eos and he did evil in the sight of the lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin. eos and baasha the son of ahijah, of the house of issachar, conspired against him; and baasha smote him at gibbethon, which belonged to the philistines; for nadab and all israel laid siege to gibbethon. eos even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead. eos and it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of jeroboam; he left not to jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the lord, which he spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite: eos because of the sins of jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger. eos now the rest of the acts of nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel? eos and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days. eos in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah, twenty and four years. eos and he did evil in the sight of the lord, and walked in the way of jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin. eos then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha, saying, eos forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people israel; and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam, and hast made my people israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; eos behold, i will take away the posterity of baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat. eos him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat. eos now the rest of the acts of baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel? eos so baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in tirzah: and elah his son reigned in his stead. eos and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of the lord against baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of jeroboam; and because he killed him. eos in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah, two years. eos and his servant zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of arza steward of his house in tirzah. eos and zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah, and reigned in his stead. eos and it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. eos thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha, according to the word of the lord, which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet. eos for all the sins of baasha, and the sins of elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made israel to sin, in provoking the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities. eos now the rest of the acts of elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel? eos in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah. and the people were encamped against gibbethon, which belonged to the philistines. eos and the people that were encamped heard say, zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all israel made omri, the captain of the host, king over israel that day in the camp. eos and omri went up from gibbethon, and all israel with him, and they besieged tirzah. eos and it came to pass, when zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died. eos for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord, in walking in the way of jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make israel to sin. eos now the rest of the acts of zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel? eos then were the people of israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath, to make him king; and half followed omri. eos but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath: so tibni died, and omri reigned. eos in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in tirzah. eos and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of shemer, owner of the hill, samaria. eos but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord, and did worse than all that were before him. eos for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin, to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities. eos now the rest of the acts of omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel? eos so omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in samaria: and ahab his son reigned in his stead. eos and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel: and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years. eos and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him. eos and it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat, that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians, and went and served baal, and worshipped him. eos and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal, which he had built in samaria. eos and ahab made a grove; and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him. eos in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segub, according to the word of the lord, which he spake by joshua the son of nun. eos and elijah the tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of gilead, said unto ahab, as the lord god of israel liveth, before whom i stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. eos and the word of the lord came unto him, saying, eos get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook cherith, that is before jordan. eos and it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. eos so he went and did according unto the word of the lord: for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith, that is before jordan. eos and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. eos and it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. eos and the word of the lord came unto him, saying, eos arise, get thee to zarephath, which belongeth to zidon, and dwell there: behold, i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. eos so he arose and went to zarephath. and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, fetch me, i pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that i may drink. eos and as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, bring me, i pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. eos and she said, as the lord thy god liveth, i have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, i am gathering two sticks, that i may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. eos and elijah said unto her, fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. eos for thus saith the lord god of israel, the barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth. eos and she went and did according to the saying of elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. eos and the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the lord, which he spake by elijah. eos and it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. eos and she said unto elijah, what have i to do with thee, o thou man of god? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? eos and he said unto her, give me thy son. and he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. eos and he cried unto the lord, and said, o lord my god, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn, by slaying her son? eos and he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the lord, and said, o lord my god, i pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. eos and the lord heard the voice of elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. eos and elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and elijah said, see, thy son liveth. eos and the woman said to elijah, now by this i know that thou art a man of god, and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth. eos and it came to pass after many days, that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year, saying, go, shew thyself unto ahab; and i will send rain upon the earth. eos and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab. and there was a sore famine in samaria. eos and ahab called obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (now obadiah feared the lord greatly: eos for it was so, when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord, that obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) eos and ahab said unto obadiah, go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. eos so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: ahab went one way by himself, and obadiah went another way by himself. eos and as obadiah was in the way, behold, elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, art thou that my lord elijah? eos and he answered him, i am: go, tell thy lord, behold, elijah is here. eos and he said, what have i sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab, to slay me? eos as the lord thy god liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, he is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. eos and now thou sayest, go, tell thy lord, behold, elijah is here. eos and it shall come to pass, as soon as i am gone from thee, that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not; and so when i come and tell ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth. eos was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord, how i hid an hundred men of the lord's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? eos and now thou sayest, go, tell thy lord, behold, elijah is here: and he shall slay me. eos and elijah said, as the lord of hosts liveth, before whom i stand, i will surely shew myself unto him to day. eos so obadiah went to meet ahab, and told him: and ahab went to meet elijah. eos and it came to pass, when ahab saw elijah, that ahab said unto him, art thou he that troubleth israel? eos and he answered, i have not troubled israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord, and thou hast followed baalim. eos now therefore send, and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel, and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at jezebel's table. eos so ahab sent unto all the children of israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel. eos and elijah came unto all the people, and said, how long halt ye between two opinions? if the lord be god, follow him: but if baal, then follow him. and the people answered him not a word. eos then said elijah unto the people, i, even i only, remain a prophet of the lord; but baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. eos let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and i will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: eos and call ye on the name of your gods, and i will call on the name of the lord: and the god that answereth by fire, let him be god. and all the people answered and said, it is well spoken. eos and elijah said unto the prophets of baal, choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under. eos and they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon, saying, o baal, hear us. but there was no voice, nor any that answered. and they leaped upon the altar which was made. eos and it came to pass at noon, that elijah mocked them, and said, cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. eos and they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. eos and it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. eos and elijah said unto all the people, come near unto me. and all the people came near unto him. and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down. eos and elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob, unto whom the word of the lord came, saying, israel shall be thy name: eos and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. eos and he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. eos and he said, do it the second time. and they did it the second time. and he said, do it the third time. and they did it the third time. eos and the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. eos and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that elijah the prophet came near, and said, lord god of abraham, isaac, and of israel, let it be known this day that thou art god in israel, and that i am thy servant, and that i have done all these things at thy word. eos hear me, o lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the lord god, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. eos then the fire of the lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. eos and when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, the lord, he is the god; the lord, he is the god. eos and elijah said unto them, take the prophets of baal; let not one of them escape. and they took them: and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon, and slew them there. eos and elijah said unto ahab, get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain. eos so ahab went up to eat and to drink. and elijah went up to the top of carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, eos and said to his servant, go up now, look toward the sea. and he went up, and looked, and said, there is nothing. and he said, go again seven times. eos and it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. and he said, go up, say unto ahab, prepare thy chariot, and get thee down that the rain stop thee not. eos and it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. and ahab rode, and went to jezreel. eos and the hand of the lord was on elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel. eos and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. eos then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah, saying, so let the gods do to me, and more also, if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time. eos and when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to beersheba, which belongeth to judah, and left his servant there. eos but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, it is enough; now, o lord, take away my life; for i am not better than my fathers. eos and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, arise and eat. eos and he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. and he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. eos and the angel of the lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said, arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. eos and he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god. eos and he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the lord came to him, and he said unto him, what doest thou here, elijah? eos and he said, i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts: for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and i, even i only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. eos and he said, go forth, and stand upon the mount before the lord. and, behold, the lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord; but the lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the lord was not in the earthquake: eos and after the earthquake a fire; but the lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. eos and it was so, when elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. and, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, what doest thou here, elijah? eos and he said, i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts: because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and i, even i only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. eos and the lord said unto him, go, return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus: and when thou comest, anoint hazael to be king over syria: eos and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel: and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. eos and it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of hazael shall jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay. eos yet i have left me seven thousand in israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. eos so he departed thence, and found elisha the son of shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. eos and he left the oxen, and ran after elijah, and said, let me, i pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then i will follow thee. and he said unto him, go back again: for what have i done to thee? eos and he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. then he arose, and went after elijah, and ministered unto him. eos and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged samaria, and warred against it. eos and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city, and said unto him, thus saith benhadad, eos thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine. eos and the king of israel answered and said, my lord, o king, according to thy saying, i am thine, and all that i have. eos and the messengers came again, and said, thus speaketh benhadad, saying, although i have sent unto thee, saying, thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; eos yet i will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away. eos then the king of israel called all the elders of the land, and said, mark, i pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and i denied him not. eos and all the elders and all the people said unto him, hearken not unto him, nor consent. eos wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad, tell my lord the king, all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do: but this thing i may not do. and the messengers departed, and brought him word again. eos and benhadad sent unto him, and said, the gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me. eos and the king of israel answered and said, tell him, let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off. eos and it came to pass, when ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, set yourselves in array. and they set themselves in array against the city. eos and, behold, there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel, saying, thus saith the lord, hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, i will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that i am the lord. eos and ahab said, by whom? and he said, thus saith the lord, even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. then he said, who shall order the battle? and he answered, thou. eos then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of israel, being seven thousand. eos and they went out at noon. but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him. eos and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, there are men come out of samaria. eos and he said, whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive. eos so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them. eos and they slew every one his man: and the syrians fled; and israel pursued them: and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen. eos and the king of israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the syrians with a great slaughter. eos and the prophet came to the king of israel, and said unto him, go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee. eos and the servants of the king of syria said unto him, their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. eos and do this thing, take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms: eos and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. and he hearkened unto their voice, and did so. eos and it came to pass at the return of the year, that benhadad numbered the syrians, and went up to aphek, to fight against israel. eos and the children of israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the syrians filled the country. eos and there came a man of god, and spake unto the king of israel, and said, thus saith the lord, because the syrians have said, the lord is god of the hills, but he is not god of the valleys, therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that i am the lord. eos and they pitched one over against the other seven days. and so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day. eos but the rest fled to aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. and benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber. eos and his servants said unto him, behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings: let us, i pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of israel: peradventure he will save thy life. eos so they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of israel, and said, thy servant benhadad saith, i pray thee, let me live. and he said, is he yet alive? he is my brother. eos now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, thy brother benhadad. then he said, go ye, bring him. then benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. eos and ben-hadad said unto him, the cities, which my father took from thy father, i will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus, as my father made in samaria. then said ahab, i will send thee away with this covenant. so he made a covenant with him, and sent him away. eos and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the lord, smite me, i pray thee. and the man refused to smite him. eos then said he unto him, because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. and as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him. eos then he found another man, and said, smite me, i pray thee. and the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him. eos so the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face. eos and as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. eos and as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. and the king of israel said unto him, so shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it. eos and he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets. eos and he said unto him, thus saith the lord, because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people. eos and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to samaria. eos and it came to pass after these things, that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in jezreel, hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria. eos and ahab spake unto naboth, saying, give me thy vineyard, that i may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, i will give thee the worth of it in money. eos and naboth said to ahab, the lord forbid it me, that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee. eos and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. and he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. eos but jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? eos and he said unto her, because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite, and said unto him, give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, i will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, i will not give thee my vineyard. eos and jezebel his wife said unto him, dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite. eos so she wrote letters in ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with naboth. eos and she wrote in the letters, saying, proclaim a fast, and set naboth on high among the people: eos and set two men, sons of belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, thou didst blaspheme god and the king. and then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. eos and the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them. eos they proclaimed a fast, and set naboth on high among the people. eos and there came in two men, children of belial, and sat before him: and the men of belial witnessed against him, even against naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, naboth did blaspheme god and the king. then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. eos then they sent to jezebel, saying, naboth is stoned, and is dead. eos and it came to pass, when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned, and was dead, that jezebel said to ahab, arise, take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for naboth is not alive, but dead. eos and it came to pass, when ahab heard that naboth was dead, that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite, to take possession of it. eos and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite, saying, eos arise, go down to meet ahab king of israel, which is in samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it. eos and thou shalt speak unto him, saying, thus saith the lord, hast thou killed, and also taken possession? and thou shalt speak unto him, saying, thus saith the lord, in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. eos and ahab said to elijah, hast thou found me, o mine enemy? and he answered, i have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord. eos behold, i will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in israel, eos and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat, and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made israel to sin. eos and of jezebel also spake the lord, saying, the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel. eos him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. eos but there was none like unto ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord, whom jezebel his wife stirred up. eos and he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the amorites, whom the lord cast out before the children of israel. eos and it came to pass, when ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. eos and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite, saying, eos seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, i will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will i bring the evil upon his house. eos and they continued three years without war between syria and israel. eos and it came to pass in the third year, that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel. eos and the king of israel said unto his servants, know ye that ramoth in gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria? eos and he said unto jehoshaphat, wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead? and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel, i am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. eos and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel, enquire, i pray thee, at the word of the lord to day. eos then the king of israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, shall i go against ramothgilead to battle, or shall i forbear? and they said, go up; for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. eos and jehoshaphat said, is there not here a prophet of the lord besides, that we might enquire of him? eos and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat, there is yet one man, micaiah the son of imlah, by whom we may enquire of the lord: but i hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. and jehoshaphat said, let not the king say so. eos then the king of israel called an officer, and said, hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah. eos and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. eos and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, thus saith the lord, with these shalt thou push the syrians, until thou have consumed them. eos and all the prophets prophesied so, saying, go up to ramothgilead, and prosper: for the lord shall deliver it into the king's hand. eos and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him, saying, behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, i pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good. eos and micaiah said, as the lord liveth, what the lord saith unto me, that will i speak. eos so he came to the king. and the king said unto him, micaiah, shall we go against ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? and he answered him, go, and prosper: for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. eos and the king said unto him, how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the lord? eos and he said, i saw all israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the lord said, these have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. eos and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat, did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? eos and he said, hear thou therefore the word of the lord: i saw the lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. eos and the lord said, who shall persuade ahab, that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead? and one said on this manner, and another said on that manner. eos and there came forth a spirit, and stood before the lord, and said, i will persuade him. eos and the lord said unto him, wherewith? and he said, i will go forth, and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. and he said, thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. eos now therefore, behold, the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee. eos but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near, and smote micaiah on the cheek, and said, which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee? eos and micaiah said, behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. eos and the king of israel said, take micaiah, and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city, and to joash the king's son; eos and say, thus saith the king, put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until i come in peace. eos and micaiah said, if thou return at all in peace, the lord hath not spoken by me. and he said, hearken, o people, every one of you. eos so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead. eos and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat, i will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. and the king of israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. eos but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of israel. eos and it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat, that they said, surely it is the king of israel. and they turned aside to fight against him: and jehoshaphat cried out. eos and it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. eos and a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for i am wounded. eos and the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. eos and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, every man to his city, and every man to his own country. eos so the king died, and was brought to samaria; and they buried the king in samaria. eos and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the lord which he spake. eos now the rest of the acts of ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel? eos so ahab slept with his fathers; and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. eos and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel. eos jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem. and his mother's name was azubah the daughter of shilhi. eos and he walked in all the ways of asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord: nevertheless the high places were not taken away;
